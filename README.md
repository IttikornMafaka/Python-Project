## 📘 About This Repository

This repository contains small and simple **Python projects** created for practice and self-learning.  
Each project focuses on building understanding of **core programming concepts**, including:

- 🧩 **Conditional statements** (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- 🔁 **Loops** (`for`, `while`)
- 🧠 **Functions** and reusable code structure
- 💬 **User input and output**
- 🗃️ **Data structures** (lists, dictionaries, tuples)
- 🎮 **Mini text-based games** for logic training

> 💡 The main goal is *learning by doing* — experimenting with Python and improving step by step.
